#Storybook Plus (SB+)
**_version 2.8.0-BPS_**

---
###Setup Information
Storybook Plus (SB+) is built with jQuery, CSS, HTML5, and VideoJS. The whole project is managed with the use of [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) to validate and minify scripts and using [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) for CSS.

**Getting the Source Files**

1. Download the source files from [BPS branch of the sbplus repository](https://github.com/oel-mediateam/sbplus/tree/bps) from the [oel-mediateam GitHub account](https://github.com/oel-mediateam). The download button is green and labeled with "Clone or download".
2. Upload everything in the `sources` folder to the web host. It is recommended to create a directory named `sbplus` in the web host, and upload the source files into that directory.
3. Inside the `example` folder, an example of the file structure is presented for a SB+ presentation project. See the [SB+ Documentation](https://media.uwex.edu/resources/documentation/storybook-plus-v2/) for details on setting up a SB+ presentation project.
..* Do not upload this folder to the web host.
