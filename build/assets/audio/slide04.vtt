00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300 align:middle line:84%

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Hi.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.200 align:middle line:90%
My name's Jerry Hembd, and I'm
going to be your instructor

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.760 align:middle line:90%
for Sustainable Management
740, the Economics of

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Sustainability.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm a professor of economics
at the University of

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Wisconsin-Superior.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm also state specialist in
Community and Economic

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.980 align:middle line:90%
Development with the
University of

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Wisconsin-Extension.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.460 align:middle line:90%
So I've got the best
of both worlds.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.650 align:middle line:90%
I get to teach part of the time,
and I'm working with

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.090 align:middle line:90%
communities around the state,
primarily in the areas of

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.480 align:middle line:84%
sustainability.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.990 align:middle line:90%
I've been at UW-Superior
since 2004.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.420 align:middle line:90%
This is my second time
at UW-Superior.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.160 align:middle line:90%
I was originally there from
1984 through 1991.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.130 align:middle line:90%
I purposefully picked my
home as a place to

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.160 align:middle line:84%
do the intro video.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.860 align:middle line:90%
Economics instructors often
start their courses by going

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.660 align:middle line:90%
back to Latin and Greek roots
of economy or economics.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:90%
And it basically means
household management.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.210 align:middle line:90%
So I thought I'd start with my
own household, make a few

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.780 align:middle line:90%
comments about management here,
and connect those in

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.660 align:middle line:84%
some way back to the course.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.150 align:middle line:90%
And as I do that, I'm going to
hit a theme that we'll be

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.690 align:middle line:90%
talking about throughout
the semester.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.980 align:middle line:90%
I like to do a lot of
contrasting between individual

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.010 align:middle line:90%
behavior, individual change
and systemic or global

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.240 align:middle line:90%
behavior or systemic change,
and sort of play those off.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.870 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to make the case
during the semester that while

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.050 align:middle line:90%
changes individual behavior
are good, that what we are

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.310 align:middle line:90%
probably really looking at is
some sort of systemic change,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.570 align:middle line:90%
maybe even a change in
paradigms, as we look at the

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.730 align:middle line:84%
economics of sustainability.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.680 align:middle line:90%
So I'll talk about a couple
examples here at home.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.930 align:middle line:90%
And I'll note right now, if
you're in a class of mine, I

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.890 align:middle line:84%
don't work without a net.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:90%
I always have notes
that refer to.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.770 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to keep referring
to those as we go along.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:90%
You can't see this looking at
me now, but I live about 20

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.610 align:middle line:84%
miles from Superior.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.510 align:middle line:90%
My wife and I both commute to
work, and our work schedules

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.630 align:middle line:84%
aren't the same.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.400 align:middle line:90%
So while we enjoy the benefits
of rural living, and there's

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.880 align:middle line:90%
some reasons why we like to live
out here, any time we do

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.460 align:middle line:90%
any sort of ecological footprint
analysis, we're way

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.570 align:middle line:84%
off the scale.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.280 align:middle line:90%
And so, while this works for
us individually, and we may

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.710 align:middle line:90%
have reasons for doing it, it's
obviously not the sort of

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.160 align:middle line:90%
commuting pattern or lifestyle
that if everybody did it in

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.630 align:middle line:90%
the world, that would be
highly unsustainable.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.400 align:middle line:90%
And so, one of the things
we'll look at during the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.330 align:middle line:90%
course is different
relationships, work, home

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.440 align:middle line:90%
relationships, and how those
might change as we look at

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.500 align:middle line:90%
individual versus
systemic change.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.280 align:middle line:84%
I have a garden out back.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.440 align:middle line:90%
I've been growing vegetables
for the last

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.885 align:middle line:84%
seven or eight years.

00:02:48.885 --> 00:02:50.790 align:middle line:84%
I use square foot gardening.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.800 align:middle line:90%
I experiment with some
permaculture techniques.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.170 align:middle line:90%
Short growing season this far
north, and I only provide a

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.820 align:middle line:84%
very small portion of my food.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a good individual change
effort, but if we're talking

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.420 align:middle line:90%
about food provision on a
national or global scale,

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.470 align:middle line:90%
obviously if everybody did what
I did, that wouldn't be

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.640 align:middle line:84%
enough food to provide food.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.450 align:middle line:90%
My wife has two sheep that her
sons gave her for a Mother's

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.570 align:middle line:90%
Day gift a few years back,
Doc and Wyatt.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.530 align:middle line:90%
Nice thing about sheep
is you can use their

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.700 align:middle line:84%
manure right on gardens.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't have to be composted.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And they provide wool.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.240 align:middle line:90%
And so, those are things
that they provide us.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.700 align:middle line:90%
But if I had to be honest, in
the main thing that the sheep

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:90%
do is they provide my wife
with a lot of joy.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.060 align:middle line:90%
She loves just looking at them,
spending time with them.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.390 align:middle line:90%
And so another thing we'll look
at during the semester is

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.430 align:middle line:90%
financial gains or material
things versus

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.110 align:middle line:84%
non-material ones.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.950 align:middle line:90%
I have my vegetable garden, if
you look behind me and around

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:53.920 align:middle line:84%
the grounds.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.470 align:middle line:90%
My wife has a lot of
flower gardens.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.510 align:middle line:90%
And that brings both of us
a lot of satisfaction.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.030 align:middle line:90%
We can't eat it, but it has
a value to us, and it's

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.170 align:middle line:84%
important for the way we live.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.580 align:middle line:90%
I mentioned before, we live
20 miles out of town.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.000 align:middle line:90%
So another thing we'll look at
in the course is rural versus

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.200 align:middle line:90%
urban behavior, living patterns,
and sustainability,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.120 align:middle line:90%
and the implications of those
two kinds of lifestyles.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.920 align:middle line:90%
Like every American, primarily,
I have all kinds of

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.700 align:middle line:84%
neat tools in my garage.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.050 align:middle line:84%
I've got a lawnmower.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.505 align:middle line:90%
Because I live up north,
I have a snow blower.

00:04:28.505 --> 00:04:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I've got a drill, table saw.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.750 align:middle line:84%
The list could go on.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.580 align:middle line:90%
And like most tools and most
people, I only use

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.670 align:middle line:84%
those every so often.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:90%
And so another thing we'll look
on the consumption side,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.300 align:middle line:90%
there's been talk recently
about collaborative

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.660 align:middle line:84%
consumption.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.800 align:middle line:90%
Probably, a lot of households
could get by with just the

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.460 align:middle line:90%
tools I've got in
my own garage.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.400 align:middle line:90%
So that would be another
systemic change, rather than

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.200 align:middle line:84%
an individual change.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.550 align:middle line:90%
I use wood as a secondary
heat source.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.970 align:middle line:90%
And we've got lots of wood in
this part of the state.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.560 align:middle line:90%
But again, that's not something
everybody could do

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.790 align:middle line:84%
at a systemic level.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.700 align:middle line:90%
One other thing I like about
living here-- and

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.820 align:middle line:84%
I've lived in cities.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.360 align:middle line:90%
In the past, I've lived in
Boston and San Francisco--

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.910 align:middle line:84%
is I know my neighbors.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.920 align:middle line:90%
And relationships are another
key part of the things we'll

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.830 align:middle line:84%
be looking at in the course.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.270 align:middle line:90%
And when we start talking
about how do we measure

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.680 align:middle line:90%
well-being, human well-being,
we'll look at the research

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.190 align:middle line:90%
that shows that, really,
it's the importance of

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.180 align:middle line:90%
relationships beyond a certain
income scale that really

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.370 align:middle line:90%
provide us with happiness
and well-being.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.880 align:middle line:90%
And these relationships with
our family, with friends,

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.260 align:middle line:84%
neighbors, and colleagues.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.460 align:middle line:90%
And so that's another thing I
like about this particular

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.370 align:middle line:84%
living choice.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.590 align:middle line:90%
The house behind me, a friend
of mine built in the 1970s.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.027 align:middle line:90%
He's about my age, and this was
a time when there was what

00:05:53.027 --> 00:05:57.950 align:middle line:90%
was referred to as the
back-to-the-land movement, the

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.800 align:middle line:90%
hippie era, I guess, for lack
of anything better to say.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.800 align:middle line:90%
A lot of recycled material has
gone into the house, railroad

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.770 align:middle line:90%
ties, floors out of old
public schools.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.150 align:middle line:90%
He found some stained glass
windows, and so we tried to

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.540 align:middle line:90%
carry that on with remodeling,
too, in

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.220 align:middle line:84%
terms of reused materials.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.360 align:middle line:90%
So that gives you a
sense of my place.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.730 align:middle line:90%
And I thought a good way to
start would be for you to know

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.860 align:middle line:84%
me, see my place.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.620 align:middle line:90%
Because I live this far out of
town, a lot of times I will be

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.750 align:middle line:90%
working on the course
I'll be here.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.150 align:middle line:90%
One of the nice things about
online courses is that I can

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.970 align:middle line:84%
do this from home.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.980 align:middle line:90%
I do have high-speed
internet access.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.150 align:middle line:90%
And so many times when I'm
interacting with you, I'll be

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.750 align:middle line:90%
sitting in my upstairs room
here, working on the course.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.950 align:middle line:90%
I want to give you, now, just
a little bit of my personal

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:90%
background, how I came to be
at Superior, and why this

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.520 align:middle line:90%
course is of particular
interest to me.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.040 align:middle line:90%
I started my professional
career here in 1984.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.140 align:middle line:90%
And I spent seven years here,
left, and came back in 2004.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.210 align:middle line:90%
And so I want to just
note some of the

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.790 align:middle line:84%
pieces along the way.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.210 align:middle line:90%
After I got my undergraduate
degree in urban planning--

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.470 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in Iowa, ended up
getting an urban planning

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.580 align:middle line:90%
degree from the College of
Agriculture, just because I

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.630 align:middle line:90%
wanted to think of both
the rural and

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.160 align:middle line:84%
urban aspects of that.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.340 align:middle line:90%
I spent a couple of years in
the Peace Corps in the

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.870 align:middle line:90%
Philippines, where I worked
as an urban planner.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.220 align:middle line:90%
And that started my longer
term interest in working

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.790 align:middle line:90%
internationally and looking at
various types of development.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.200 align:middle line:90%
After my Peace Corps years,
I got a master's degree in

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.310 align:middle line:90%
agricultural economics at the
University of Kentucky.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.030 align:middle line:90%
They were actively recruiting
ex-Peace Corps volunteers.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.320 align:middle line:90%
And one of the things I
discovered working with

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.340 align:middle line:90%
communities in the Philippines
was what they really were

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.480 align:middle line:90%
interested in was economic
knowledge and strong

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.180 align:middle line:90%
agricultural background, which,
although I was an Iowa

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.710 align:middle line:90%
farm boy originally, I really
didn't have in terms of

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.620 align:middle line:90%
through the economics
of agriculture.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.600 align:middle line:90%
So I went back, got
my degree there.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.780 align:middle line:90%
My graduate school
agreed with me.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.170 align:middle line:90%
I went on to get another MA
and then a PhD in applied

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.730 align:middle line:90%
economics from Stanford
University.

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:90%
And I did my dissertation
research.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.060 align:middle line:90%
I was able to go back to the
Philippines on a Fulbright

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.460 align:middle line:90%
grant where I looked at uneven
regional development in the

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Philippines.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.790 align:middle line:90%
My first job, then, was here
at UW-S. And as I mentioned

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:27.330 align:middle line:90%
before, it's split appointment
between teaching and outreach.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.090 align:middle line:90%
I went from here to Iowa State
University for three years,

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.669 align:middle line:90%
where I directed the community
development program

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:37.350 align:middle line:90%
state-wide, as well as taught in
the Department of Community

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.960 align:middle line:84%
and Regional Planning.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.770 align:middle line:90%
Then I had either a midlife
epiphany or midlife crisis,

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.020 align:middle line:90%
depending on how you want
to think about it.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:51.370 align:middle line:90%
I stepped away from my tenured
faculty appointment and did

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:54.690 align:middle line:90%
some camping and hiking around
for about a half a year, and

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:90%
then took a short-term teaching
position with the

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:03.110 align:middle line:90%
National Economics University
in Hanoi, Vietnam.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:90%
Actually, this is before
we had formal

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.530 align:middle line:84%
relationships with Vietnam.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:11.450 align:middle line:90%
And so I had the opportunity to
teach Vietnamese academics

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:15.130 align:middle line:90%
and practitioners interested
in economic development,

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle line:90%
sustainability, and
microeconomics.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.630 align:middle line:84%

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.360 align:middle line:90%
After that, I taught for a
couple of years with what's

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.290 align:middle line:90%
called the International
Honors Program.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.120 align:middle line:90%
It was a global ecology program
where we traveled

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.190 align:middle line:90%
around the world for
eight months.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.360 align:middle line:90%
30 undergraduates, and there
were three traveling faculty

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.120 align:middle line:90%
members and ecologists
and economists and an

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.060 align:middle line:84%
anthropologist.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:90%
And that was an amazing way to
teach and learn as we spent a

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.750 align:middle line:90%
lot of our time in villages
in a variety of countries.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.330 align:middle line:90%
And then before coming back to
UW-Superior, I worked for a

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.860 align:middle line:90%
couple of years with an
organization called Future

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.270 align:middle line:90%
Generations, and helped them
develop a master's degree in

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:56.912 align:middle line:90%
applied community change
and conservation.

00:09:56.912 --> 00:09:59.790 align:middle line:90%
So I helped develop that, and
I got to teach in that

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.070 align:middle line:90%
program, and went with the
students there when

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.050 align:middle line:84%
they went to India.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.420 align:middle line:90%
So if I had to give us a summary
of my background, my

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.430 align:middle line:90%
key interests have been
international.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.130 align:middle line:90%
I've got a long-term interest in
things international, going

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.935 align:middle line:84%
back to my Peace Corps days.

00:10:15.935 --> 00:10:20.190 align:middle line:90%
I've got a long interest
in sustainability.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.160 align:middle line:90%
I think the Peace Corps
experience got me started to

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.700 align:middle line:90%
think about it, carried through
graduate school.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:30.910 align:middle line:90%
And when I got my PhD in the
early '80s, 1980s, there

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.230 align:middle line:90%
wasn't a lot of interest or call
for people that taught

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.470 align:middle line:84%
sustainability.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:38.960 align:middle line:90%
So it's been really exciting for
me the last 10 to 15 years

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.590 align:middle line:84%
to see that turn around.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.960 align:middle line:90%
And now, at this stage in my
career, it's really fun for me

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.390 align:middle line:90%
to actually be able to bring
their expertise to bear in

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.820 align:middle line:84%
classes like this one.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.810 align:middle line:90%
So in a sense, this is a class
I've been wanting to teach all

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:52.630 align:middle line:84%
of my career.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.150 align:middle line:90%
So I'm really excited about
being able to teach it.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.360 align:middle line:90%
The other two emphasis areas
are development--

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.110 align:middle line:90%
and although it's economic
development, it could be

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.060 align:middle line:90%
community development,
agricultural development, I

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:08.200 align:middle line:90%
look at development from a lot
of different lenses or

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.400 align:middle line:84%
viewpoints.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:14.180 align:middle line:90%
And then since I've been working
with UW-Superior and

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.570 align:middle line:90%
UW-Extension, a lot of my work
is at the community level.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:21.190 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm not just a
classroom teacher.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.930 align:middle line:90%
3/4 of my position is actually
working directly with

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:25.610 align:middle line:84%
communities around the state.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.500 align:middle line:90%
And I also share this at
national conferences through

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.200 align:middle line:84%
professional associations.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:35.050 align:middle line:90%
So I've got a long-term history
of working directly

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.750 align:middle line:90%
with communities, especially
local governments and

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.690 align:middle line:84%
nonprofit organizations.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.660 align:middle line:90%
And lately, this has taken me
into things like The Natural

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:47.320 align:middle line:90%
Step, Transition Towns, Business
Alliance for Local

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Living Economies,

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.610 align:middle line:84%
permaculture, ecological economics.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.500 align:middle line:90%
A lot of these are topics
that we will be

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.300 align:middle line:84%
touching on in the course.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.690 align:middle line:90%
So just some comments
about the course.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.740 align:middle line:90%
I'll be overviewing each of the
units separately, but I

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.950 align:middle line:90%
want to just give you some
operational notion of how I

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.970 align:middle line:90%
come at the course, and some
of my views, and, to some

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.310 align:middle line:84%
extent, expectations.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:17.340 align:middle line:90%
My orientation is looking at
this course as understanding

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:21.300 align:middle line:90%
the relationship between the
human enterprise, what we as

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.460 align:middle line:90%
humans do, and that relationship
with the global

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.870 align:middle line:90%
ecosystem, and specifically
the economic

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:29.950 align:middle line:84%
components of that.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:90%
My sense is you'll be hearing
a lot about economic trends

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.870 align:middle line:90%
and implications in a lot
of the other courses.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:39.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to come at it more
specifically from the view

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.950 align:middle line:90%
from the economics discipline,
both in a conventional manner

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:46.400 align:middle line:84%
and an alternative manner.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.920 align:middle line:90%
There is no prereq to get into
this major or this course.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.260 align:middle line:90%
And so if you're concerned about
not having had economics

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.670 align:middle line:90%
before, I have a history of
teaching classes for both

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:01.790 align:middle line:90%
non-majors and people without
any economics background.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:05.110 align:middle line:90%
I've kept that in mind as I've
developed this course.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.630 align:middle line:90%
There will be a couple places
during the semester where

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.200 align:middle line:90%
there will be some expectation
for those of you that have not

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.900 align:middle line:90%
had economics to do a
little extra work.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.300 align:middle line:90%
But I'll provide the information
that you need to

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:20.060 align:middle line:90%
do that, because it's really
important for you to

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:24.020 align:middle line:90%
understand where economics is
now to have a better sense of

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:29.080 align:middle line:90%
where it can and should go in
the future, and also why

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.620 align:middle line:90%
certain policies are in place
based on the prevailing

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.740 align:middle line:84%
economic paradigm.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.420 align:middle line:90%
I always tell students that
this isn't a class to give

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.900 align:middle line:84%
them the right answers.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.450 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of turmoil and
change within the economics

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:42.650 align:middle line:84%
profession right now.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:45.600 align:middle line:90%
And we'll be looking at that
from a number of different

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.720 align:middle line:84%
perspectives.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.840 align:middle line:90%
My intent is more to help
you ask either good

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:51.905 align:middle line:84%
or the right questions.

00:13:51.905 --> 00:13:55.640 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a big emphasis
on probing into material.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to be selling
a particular viewpoint.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to try to lay out
conventional versus

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.480 align:middle line:90%
alternative thinking and then
ask you to make your own

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:90%
decision on what makes the most
sense to you and why, to

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.240 align:middle line:90%
make a case for why
you feel that way.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.810 align:middle line:90%
At this point in my professional
career, I also

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:17.170 align:middle line:90%
feel like I have
become somewhat

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:18.790 align:middle line:84%
of an economic historian.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:22.860 align:middle line:90%
And so I will be weaving longer
term trends into the

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.920 align:middle line:84%
way that I outline the class.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's not an economics class
in a conventional sense.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.120 align:middle line:90%
I have a lot of emphasis on
ecological economics, and that

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:37.210 align:middle line:90%
is a trans-disciplinary field,
so cutting across a lot of

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.540 align:middle line:84%
different disciplines.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.390 align:middle line:90%
And I've been weaving
these together

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.420 align:middle line:84%
for quite a few years.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:46.160 align:middle line:90%
So economics core, but a
trans-disciplinary approach.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.640 align:middle line:90%
And where one of the key
questions beyond the

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.270 align:middle line:90%
individual global question
is looking at the

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.440 align:middle line:84%
system we have in place.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.020 align:middle line:90%
Is there the potential
to reform the system?

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.900 align:middle line:90%
Or do we need some sort of
alternative system, be it

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:06.530 align:middle line:90%
economic, political, social,
or environmental?

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.290 align:middle line:84%
All of you in this program are

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:11.280 align:middle line:84%
professionals in your own right.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.260 align:middle line:90%
You're all knowledgeable
in your own right.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.880 align:middle line:90%
And so I want to acknowledge
that, front and center.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.490 align:middle line:90%
My expectation is that each
of you will bring your own

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:23.900 align:middle line:90%
expertise to the course, that
you'll bring your own

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.690 align:middle line:84%
contributions to the course.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:30.420 align:middle line:90%
And so this isn't just a one-way
education learning

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.460 align:middle line:84%
experience.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.450 align:middle line:90%
You'll be sharing with all of
your peers in the course some

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:35.780 align:middle line:84%
of your own knowledge.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.410 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like having a whole
set of teachers and

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:42.510 align:middle line:90%
learners, rather than the
traditional teacher and a set

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.200 align:middle line:84%
of learners.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.610 align:middle line:90%
The other orientation I
have is that I like--

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:50.530 align:middle line:84%
at least I'm hopeful--

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:54.520 align:middle line:90%
I think of you as change agents,
some sort of catalyst

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.590 align:middle line:84%
for change.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.120 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm hoping that you'll
take not just what you get

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.160 align:middle line:90%
from this course, but from the
whole program, back out and

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.890 align:middle line:90%
have the opportunity to make
positive change, both

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:08.860 align:middle line:90%
individually, in your community,
in the nation, and,

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.440 align:middle line:84%
ideally, globally.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.110 align:middle line:84%
I want to also note--

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:16.340 align:middle line:90%
I came across this
the other day--

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.500 align:middle line:90%
some people get very
concerned about the

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.260 align:middle line:84%
urgency of the situation.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.410 align:middle line:90%
And I can understand that,
if you look at

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.550 align:middle line:84%
the trends and data.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:31.120 align:middle line:90%
But EF Schumacher many years ago
cautioned everyone that we

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.810 align:middle line:84%
need to be patient.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.910 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I tell
colleagues and

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.520 align:middle line:84%
students, as well.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.780 align:middle line:90%
I've gotten to be more patient
over the years.

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.770 align:middle line:90%
And what Schumacher said was
that we each need to build

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:46.160 align:middle line:90%
what he called alternative
lifeboats.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:51.650 align:middle line:90%
In a way, my home here and some
of the practices I use

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.260 align:middle line:90%
are part of my alternative
lifeboat.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.460 align:middle line:90%
It's showing a way
to do things.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:00.620 align:middle line:90%
And there are many kinds of
alternatives being tried all

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.290 align:middle line:84%
over the world.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:02.920 align:middle line:90%
And we'll be trying
to weave those in

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.020 align:middle line:84%
as part of the course.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.960 align:middle line:90%
Finally, just a couple of notes
about the relationship

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.869 align:middle line:84%
between you and me.

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:14.960 align:middle line:90%
Input, questions of any type
are always welcomed.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.230 align:middle line:90%
This is meant to be high
level of communication.

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:22.000 align:middle line:84%

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.760 align:middle line:90%
The best way to contact
me is by email.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.859 align:middle line:90%
I check my email
very regularly.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.840 align:middle line:90%
And if we need to have a
telephone conversation, we

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.140 align:middle line:90%
need to do Skype, whatever the
case may be, start the

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.800 align:middle line:90%
connection with email, and
we'll make sure that it

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.500 align:middle line:84%
happens as soon as possible.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm very, very comfortable with
having you call me Jerry.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.880 align:middle line:90%
If you're comfortable
with that, I am.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.350 align:middle line:84%
That's my name.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And so, feel free to do that.

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:50.510 align:middle line:90%
All my emails will be signed
Jerry and all the other notes.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I'll use
through the course.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:58.610 align:middle line:90%
So in closing, as I noted
before, because you all bring

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:02.220 align:middle line:90%
so much to the course, I'm
really looking forward to

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:06.310 align:middle line:90%
learning with you and
from you as we move

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:07.560 align:middle line:84%
through this semester.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.921 align:middle line:84%
